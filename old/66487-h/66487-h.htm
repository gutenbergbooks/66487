  <h2 class='c010'>TO THE READER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Though no apology for the present publication, or for the form in which it appears,
will be attempted, yet it may not be improper or uninteresting to state a few facts relating
to its origin.</p>

<p class='c012'>The author has been in the habit, for a number of years past, of celebrating the anniversary
of our Independence with public worship in his own congregation. Previous to
the last 4th of July, notice to that effect was given, and at the same time it was stated that
the subject of discourse would be—not American <i>Liberty</i>, but—American <i>Slavery</i>: in connexion
with which, the object and operations of “<i>The American Colonization Society</i>” would
be brought into view, and its claims upon publick patronage defended and urged. A similar
notice was sent to the other congregations in this place with an invitation to attend.</p>

<p class='c012'>To a very respectable audience, thus convened, the following discourse was delivered,
and a contribution taken up in aid of the Colonization Society.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the close of the service, a meeting was organized, of which the following are the
minutes:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>The Hon.</i> John M’Lean <i>was chosen Chairman, and</i> Gerrit Wendell, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>The following resolutions were then unanimously adopted.</i></p>

<p class='c012'>“Resolved, <i>That it is expedient and proper, in the view of this meeting, hereafter to
celebrate the anniversary of our National Independence with religious exercises.</i></p>

<p class='c012'>“Resolved, <i>That Messrs.</i> John Ashton, Sidney Wells <i>and Dr.</i> Matthew Stevenson
<i>be a committee to make arrangements for the next anniversary, by designating the place of
meeting, and procuring a speaker for the occasion</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>On motion of Mr.</i> Ashton, <i>seconded by</i> Sidney Wells,—Resolved <i>that the Rev. Mr.</i>
Prime <i>be requested to furnish for the press, a copy of the Address delivered by him this day,
and that the above mentioned committee be authorized to adopt the necessary measures to procure
its publication</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Although the proposal of the last resolution was totally unexpected to the author,
yet he is willing frankly to acknowledge that its adoption was extremely grateful to his
feelings; not only as an explicit approval of the sentiments which had been delivered,
expressed by many of his own congregation and others, whose judgment he highly reveres;
but also as affording the sanction of their authority in proclaiming them to the world. And,
that it might have the full influence of that authority, the address is printed, with the exception
of a few verbal corrections, and the addition of two notes, precisely as it was delivered.</p>

<p class='c012'>The author cannot say that the views exhibited are the result of any new convictions
in his own mind. Though he was familiar with slavery from his birth, yet from his earliest
recollection, it was revolting to his feelings; and the first emotion of humanity that left an
indelible impression on his memory, was that of commisseration for the degraded condition
of a negro child about two years younger than himself; and from that moment, he never felt
at rest on the subject, till the last vestige of the evil was removed from his parental dwelling.
The same sentiments with respect to the universal guilt, and consequent danger of
the American people, he has entertained ever since he became acquainted with the institutions
of his country, and has occasionally exhibited them; but he acknowledges himself
highly censurable in not having more frequently and pointedly urged them. He therefore
presents this address to the publick, not only in compliance with the wishes of those whom
he cannot refuse, but as a small atonement for having so often neglected to employ his pen,
and raise his voice against an evil so extensive in its operation, and so alarming in its consequences.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>A DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>THE words from which I propose to address you,
on this occasion, you will find recorded in “The <span class='fss'>DECLARATION</span>
of the <span class='fss'>INDEPENDENCE</span> of the <span class='fss'>UNITED STATES</span> of
<span class='fss'>AMERICA</span>;”—the first clause after the preamble.</p>

<p class='c012'>The words are these:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men
are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights; that among these are Life,
Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.</i>”</p>

<p class='c014'>Man, considered as a rational and social being, occupies
a variety of important relations in the universe
of God. In the first place he stands related to that great
and glorious Being who gave him existence, and he is
under the most solemn and indissoluble obligations, to
the exercise of eternal reverence, love and gratitude.
However indifferent he may feel, in his present fallen
state, to the demands of heaven, and however negligent
he may be of the duties which result from those demands,
it is an incontrovertible truth, that the service of
God has the first and highest claim. Hence, the first
and greatest commandment of the law is declared, by
the divine Saviour to be this; “<i>Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.</i>” Mark xii.
30. An immediate and constant compliance with this
precept should be the first object of every human being.</p>

<p class='c012'>But although this is the first, it is not the only duty
of man. He occupies other relations, and, of course,
is subjected to the authority of other duties. Passing
over all the other subordinate connexions of man, as
foreign from our present purpose, I shall here notice
only his relation to his own species, and the obligations
which result from that relation. All men are formed
by the same hand, born into the same world, under the
same circumstances, and are bound by considerations
both of duty and interest to respect each other’s rights,
and to promote each other’s happiness. These duties
are next in importance to those which relate to God.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Therefore, our blessed Lord, after declaring the precept
already quoted to be the first commandment of
the law, adds, “And the second is like” to it, “<i>Thou
shall love thy neighbour as thyself</i>.” He then declares,
with respect to both, “There is no commandment greater
than these.” Here then we have a concise, but
complete exposition of man’s duty in relation to his
own species. It is applicable to all the possible circumstances
of life; and at the same time, so plain, that
the smallest share of intellect is sufficient to understand
and apply it. It accords precisely with that golden
rule which the Saviour delivered, in his sermon on the
mount; “<i>All things whatsoever ye would that men should
do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and
the prophets.</i>” Matthew vii. 12. That is, all the duties
which God has ever required of man in relation to his
own species, either in the law or the prophets, are comprehended
in this single precept, <i>Do to others just as you
would wish them to do to you</i>. Did this principle regulate
the conduct of all men, the earth would instantly
resume the first bloom of Eden. Not only would war,
and murder and rapine cease to desolate the earth, but
animosities and contention and oppression of every
kind and degree would instantly disappear. Adventitious
circumstances might still produce distinctions in
the relative situations of men; but pride, that fiend of
hell and enemy of happiness, would be banished from
the human breast; and one more prospered of heaven
than his fellows, would look down upon them, not to
despise their poverty, nor to rejoice in their misery,
nor to deprive them of their <i>liberty</i>; (the last earthly
blessing that man can lose;) but to compassionate their
necessities, to console them under adversity, and to administer
to their relief. The whole human family would
be bound together by the sense of a common nature,
and the bonds of sincere affection: in a word, they
would feel that they were <i>bone of each other’s bone; and
flesh of each other’s flesh</i>; and in all cases, and under all
circumstances, they would act like <i>brethren</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>From these remarks, you will perceive that the
words of my text, although they are not a part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>inspired volume, contain sentiments in perfect accordance
with the divine declarations. This consideration
therefore is sufficient to entitle them to the highest respect.
But, in this favoured land, they do not need this
argument to give them authority. They are the words
of our <i>fathers</i>; not spoken by the fireside, or in the closet,
while they rested quietly in the midst of their domestick
circles, without a witness of their declarations;
but proclaimed and published to the whole world, while
they stood in jeopardy of their lives and all that they
held dear on earth; and with a solemn appeal <i>to the</i> <span class='small'>SUPREME
JUDGE</span> <i>of the world for the rectitude of [their] intentions</i>.
Nay, more; some of them sealed this declaration
with their own blood, and voluntarily laid down
their lives, to deliver their posterity from tyranny and
oppression, and to procure for them the blessings of <i>liberty</i>
and self-government. Confining ourselves to this
view of the subject, we should pronounce that native
American unworthy of his parentage and the name
which he bears, who would not revere the words of his
father, uttered under such circumstances. Nay, that
man, let him be who he will, and let his circumstances
be what they may, is unworthy to tread American soil
and breathe American air, who does not cheerfully and
sincerely adopt the words of my text, as containing the
sentiments of his heart, “<i>All men are created equal, and
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>When this declaration, particularly this clause of
it, was reported in heaven, (and I presume to believe
that the sun had not set on the fourth of July, 1776, before
the transactions of the American Congress were
published to the celestial hosts,) what think you were
the expectations of angels and the spirits of just men
made perfect, with respect to the state of things which
would succeed in this nation? Doubtless, the former,
in whose respective ranks <i>liberty</i> and <i>equality</i> are not
only <i>professed</i> but <i>practised</i>, expected, upon their first
mission to this lower world, to see the American people,
without distinction of complexion or circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>enjoying the blessings of freedom. And with equal
probability may we imagine, that those happy
souls who had been redeemed from the earth, and who
had here witnessed, with their own eyes, the oppressions
of man exercised upon his own species; some of
whom had, perhaps, themselves been personally guilty
in this matter, and had found, from their own experience,
that the last pollution, from which a Saviour’s
blood can wash the human soul, is the sweat or blood
of a black man’s body; I say, we may safely imagine,
that, among these, there was one universal shout of joy.
They rejoiced to hear, that, in one nation at least of
this fallen world, after the lapse of almost 6000 years,
<span class='fss'>THE RIGHTS OF MAN</span> were at last understood, and a solemn
resolution to respect them had been unanimously
adopted: that universal emancipation had been proclaimed
to three millions of the human family.</p>

<p class='c012'>In view of these considerations, could angels and
redeemed souls have reasonably expected or believed,
<i>if there is any sincerity in man</i>, that from the benefits of
this solemn declaration, adopted under all the solemn
circumstances just mentioned, and with the most solemn
appeal to heaven, <i>every sixth man</i> was excluded,
and <i>doomed to perpetual slavery</i>; and <i>that</i>, for no other
reason, than because the God of nature had caused
them to be born in a torrid clime, where the sun had
burnt their skin and crisped their hair, and they had
been transported against their will, to a land inhabited
by white men?</p>

<p class='c012'>And if the celestial hosts were then restrained from
an universal clamour of disapprobation, by the consideration
that such an exception was rendered necessary
by the existing circumstances of the country, and the
impossibility of emancipating 500,000 slaves while our
shores were invaded by a foreign foe; could they have
been persuaded to believe, that, after heaven had espoused
the cause of America, and God himself had fought
her battles, and victory had crowned her arms, the American
people would permit almost half a century to
roll away in the enjoyment of unexampled liberty,
prosperity and happiness, while slavery would be permitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>to increase with the increase of their wealth and
population? Could they expect that this solemn declaration
of Independence would be annually read the
50th time, accompanied with the roar of cannon, the display
of banners, and shouts of joy, and that thousands
and hundreds of thousands of dollars would be expended
on every return of this anniversary in feasting and
dissipation and tumult, and yet <i>no year of Jubilee</i> be
proclaimed to the oppressed sons of Africa?</p>

<p class='c012'>But such is the fact. This day commences the
50th year of freedom to American white men, and
yet a million and a half of our fellow men, within our
own dwellings, are this moment groaning under the
chains of bondage. Tell me not, as it is often told by
the advocates of slavery, that they are incapable of
providing for themselves; and are therefore happier in
their present dependent condition, than if they were
immediately emancipated. I cheerfully admit that the
little feathered songster that was hatched in a cage or
incarcerated before his wings were fledged, may be ignorant
of most of the sweets of liberty; and after being
long accustomed to have his food provided by his owner’s
hand, might be incapable of finding it, in equal profusion,
in the fields and forests; but does this prove that
he has not a nature adapted to the enjoyment of liberty,
and equally entitled to the privilege with other
birds?</p>

<p class='c012'>But on this point reasoning is needless. I appeal
to my text. “<span class='sc'>All</span> <i>men are created equal</i>,” said
our forefathers, “<i>and are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights; among these are life</i>, <span class='fss'>LIBERTY</span>
<i>and the pursuit of happiness</i>.” For the space of fifty
years we have been reiterating the same maxim and at
the same time declaring that it is “a self-evident truth.”
Now, I say, let us aim at consistency of character. Let
us reduce the principle to practice, and prove to the
world that we believe what we say, or blot it out from the
declaration of our rights and privileges. We may abhor
the tyranny of kings and emperors, and commiserate
the degraded state of their oppressed subjects, but
a greater incongruity cannot be found in any nation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>than that which exists in our own. In one hand we
hold the protestation that all men are equal, and entitled
to the enjoyment of life and liberty; and in the
other, we firmly grasp the chains of slavery and wield
the goads of correction. We proclaim to the world
that we are the only nation of freemen on earth, and
yet daily practise the most absolute despotism. It is
frequently the case that the same publick newspaper
which unblushingly asserts the equality of our rights,
and the justice of our institutions, advertises a whole
village of <i>human beings for sale</i>. Again I say, let us
aim at <span class='fss'>CONSISTENCY</span>: either acknowledge to the world
that we are tyrants and despots, or act according to our
professions.</p>

<p class='c012'>That my text contains a correct assertion, I am
not disposed for a moment to question: and I should
surely be employed to no purpose in attempting to
prove to others, what they have asserted for half a century,
to be “a self-evident truth.” If then, all men are,
by their birth, entitled to the same natural rights and
privileges, they can be divested of them only by the authority
of Him who has the power of life and death in
his hands. The God of nature has a perfect right to
authorize one nation to subjugate another, as he delivered
the Canaanites into the hands of Israel. But surely
this is no argument in favour of American slavery.
When we have found a “<i>Thus saith the Lord</i>” for the
subjugation of Africans, then, and not till then, shall we
have a right to make them our slaves.</p>

<p class='c012'>A man may also forfeit his liberty, and even his life,
by the commission of crimes against the interests of society.
And in all such cases, every nation on the globe
has a charter from the King of heaven to inflict merited
punishment. But surely no man of common sense will
pretend that this authorizes any individual or commonwealth
to reduce to perpetual bondage, and entail the
same on their posterity, those who have never violated
a single law of the land.</p>

<p class='c012'>The time has been when the event of war has been
supposed to confer on the victorious party the right of
enslaving the vanquished. But this is now universally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>acknowledged to be a principle of barbarism, and is
abandoned by the civilized world. Where then is our
charter for the oppression of our fellow men?</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the most plausible argument in support of
American slavery, (and it is one that has been newly
discovered, for it was first introduced into Congress on
the Missouri question,) is, that the New Testament distinctly
recognises without any mark of disapprobation,
the relation of masters and servants, and St. Paul in his
Epistles explicitly enjoins on the latter the duty of respect,
obedience and fidelity. This argument has been
triumphantly urged as presenting Divine authority for
slavery. But pray tell me, are there no servants but
slaves? Is there no such thing as the relation of master
and servant unless where slavery exists? If so, tell
Great Britain to blot the word from her vocabulary,
that it has no meaning in the English language, and is
exclusively of American origin and use.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” says the advocate of slavery, “this argument
is not to be got rid of in this way. This is mere
quibbling. St. Paul speaks not only of servants, but
of <i>bond-men</i>; and he actually enjoins it on every man
to abide in the same calling, or condition, wherein he
is called. And he specifies particularly that if any
one is called being a <i>servant</i>, he is to rest contented
with the assurance that he is the Lord’s <i>free man</i>. 1 Cor.
vii. 20-22. Nay, in his Epistle to Philemon, he had a
fair opportunity to put this question at rest for ever;
but instead of rebuking the master for holding slaves,
he returned the <i>runaway</i> to his service.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> On this
ground, it has been asserted, that those who hold slaves
are more obedient to the Scriptures than those who do
not.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c016'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This whole argument, in all its parts, was once urged with amazing zeal, on the
floor of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>If I am not greatly mistaken in regard to the nature
of this argument, I could prove, in the same way, that
tyranny and despotism are approved of God; and that
those who submit to such a kind of government, live in
greater conformity to the Scriptures than the citizens
of a republick.</p>

<p class='c012'>The manner in which I would argue is this. St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans, says, “Let every
soul be subject unto the higher powers; for there is no
power but of God, the powers that be, are ordained of
God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth
the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall
receive to themselves damnation.”—Rom. xiii. 1, 2.
Now this solemn injunction, under this awful sanction,
was imposed by inspiration upon the Christians of
Rome, at the time that the crown of that empire was
worn by Nero, one of the most cruel and blood-thirsty
tyrants that ever disgraced a throne. By his own direction
the city was set on fire, which raged for nine
successive days, spreading desolation and ruin; and
then to furnish himself a pretext for persecuting the
Christians, he laid the crime to their charge, and fiercely
commenced the bloody work. “Some were wrapped
in the skins of wild beasts, and torn in pieces by
dogs; some were crucified, and others, clothed in garments
covered with pitch, were set on fire; while the
cruel monster calmly sat in the window of his palace
and enjoyed the scene of his own barbarities.” And
yet this is the man, whom the apostle commands the
Christians to revere as “the minister of God;” the resistance
of whom is threatened with damnation. Was
not Paul then the advocate of tyranny and oppression?
Just as clearly as he was the advocate of slavery.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the same manner I think it can be shown that
polygamy is approved by St. Paul, at least among the
Gentiles. He expressly ordained that “a bishop or
deacon must be the husband of one wife.” 1 Tim. iii. 2,
12. Now the inference is fair, that all other men might
have more than one. Private members of the church
are not restricted in their inclinations in this respect,
only the officers of the church are not indulged. I see
no way to avoid this conclusion. How then shall we
reconcile these apparent inconsistencies?</p>

<p class='c012'>In my view, the solution is plain and easy. Upon
the first introduction of the gospel into any pagan land,
there always will be many evils existing, which are so
completely wrought into the customs, interests and institutions
of society, that it is impossible to correct
them at once. Nay, if it were possible, the sudden revolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>would instantly produce unspeakable misery.
Take, for instance, the last mentioned case: Suppose,
in a nation where polygamy is extensively practised, every
man could be induced to repudiate all his wives
but one; how many thousands of helpless women and
children would be turned on the wide world, without
the means of support, exposed to inevitable wretchedness
and want! The sudden adoption of the true Christian
principle, under these circumstances, would be productive
of vastly greater misery than is now experienced
from this horrid pagan practice; and the Christian
religion would be execrated as a system of cruelty.</p>

<p class='c012'>What then is to be done? Must Christianity sacrifice
its holy principles at the shrine of pagan impurity?
Must we be satisfied to have men embrace <i>the
faith of the gospel</i>, while they retain their own <i>ungodly
practices</i>? No! But wisdom is profitable to direct.—Some
method must be adopted by which these deeply-rooted
evils may be branded with disgrace, and
thus gradually but effectually eradicated. For this
purpose St. Paul, or rather the Holy Spirit, ordained
in those countries where polygamy was common,
that “a bishop or deacon must be the husband of one
wife.” A man that sincerely embraced the gospel,
might be admitted to the privileges of the church without
first turning half a dozen women out of doors; but
he never could arise to any dignity, or be capable of
holding any office in the church. Now you plainly
perceive that the necessary operation of this simple regulation,
was to abolish gradually, but effectually, this
vile practice; not however, by sovereign authority or
absolute force, but by the voluntary consent of the party
concerned.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus it appears to be the genius of the gospel to
tolerate an evil for a while, where the immediate and
total abolition would be productive of greater miseries
and crimes; while, at the same time, it requires the
use of all prudent and effectual measures for its ultimate
extirpation.</p>

<p class='c012'>I humbly conceive that it is on this ground alone,
that the Scriptures, in certain cases, allude to despotism,
slavery and many other evils without a distinct expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of disapprobation. Had the evangelists and
apostles explicitly denounced the tyranny of Rome,
and declared that slavery was contrary to the law of
nature, and the law of God, they would have been instantly
slain, or driven, at the point of the sword, from
every province of the Roman empire.</p>

<p class='c012'>On this account every argument founded on such
texts of Scripture in support of slavery, is of no more
weight than the dust of the balance.</p>

<p class='c012'>That slavery is an evil is generally acknowledged
in those parts of our country where the least of it exists;
and of course, where the most of its horrors are
unknown. And there are undoubtedly many in the
slave-holding states who deplore the evil, and would
gladly remove it, if there was no obstacle in the way.
But it is a matter of deep regret that there are thousands
of our countrymen, claiming the style of republicans,
who are the unblushing advocates of slavery. And
what is worse than all, and what renders the extirpation
of this evil the more hopeless, is, that when our northern
citizens remove to the south, many of them become
not only the owners of slaves, but in many instances,
the warmest advocates of the principle of slavery.
This amazing change in sentiment and feeling,
I am unwilling to ascribe so much to what is often alleged,
that they find the evils of slavery far less than
they expected, and the subjects of it contented and
happy; as to the fact, that familiarity with any vice
blinds the human mind to its enormity. I doubt not
that the most enthusiastick republican of our country, if
he found it for his interest to reside under the most despotick
government of Europe, would, after a number of
years, return with the report, that the subjects of that
country were much better contented, and vastly more
happy than he had anticipated; and it would not be
strange if his zeal for democracy, and hatred of monarchy
were equally diminished. But this would never
prove to me, that the subjects of a despotism are as
happy as they would be, if they were placed in a situation,
and prepared, to enjoy the blessings of a free government.</p>

<p class='c012'>That this is the true reason of this change, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>think is evident from the fact, that our northern men,
after they become familiar with slavery, can calmly indulge
themselves in that kind of treatment of slaves,
which would previously have made them shudder. In
this connexion I will mention a <i>fact</i>, which for the credit
of New-England, and the honour of religion, I would
gladly conceal to the judgment day, if the circumstances
of the case had not been publicly displayed through
this region of country. Two years ago a native of
Vermont, and a minister of the gospel too, who has resided
some years at the South, passed with his family,
through this town and put up for the night within the
sound of my voice where I now stand. They were attended
by a servant-girl, who was not permitted to eat
at a table or sleep on a bed, though in the true spirit of
northern feeling, both were kindly proffered by the
landlady. She spent her night on the naked floor, with
no other pillow than her bundle of clothes; and set out
in the morning in an open waggon, to endure the heat
of a summer’s sun, with no other covering for her head
than the woolly fleece which nature gave. Such kind
of treatment, for aught I know, may be deemed necessary
at the south, as I understood, it was then alleged,
to keep the blacks from being “<i>exalted above measure</i>;”
yet surely it cannot be witnessed, without sentiments
of indignation, in a northern clime. And for the honour
of humanity, to say nothing of the gospel ministry,
I pray God, that my own eyes may never again witness
a similar scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>But let the plea be reiterated as often as it may,
that the slavery which exists in our country is not so
appalling as northern men suppose; it is still an evil,
that exists contrary to the law of nature and nature’s
God, and in the face too, of American rights and privileges.
And beyond this, it stands necessarily connected
with other evils, which are more shocking to the
feelings of humanity, than slavery itself. Take for example,
these simple facts. By the laws of some of the
slave-holding states, no man can emancipate his own
slaves; and any person is liable to the barbarous and
disgraceful punishment of being <i>whipped</i> on the naked
back, if convicted of <i>teaching a slave to read</i>. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the poor Africans are not only deprived of their liberty,
but are completely cut off from almost the only
means of information, with respect to their duty to God
and their fellow men, and of preparation for the eternal
world; of the only means that can alleviate their
sorrows and enliven their solitude. By these laws, a
pious and benevolent master, who has inherited a hundred
slaves, and who would gladly deliver them from
bondage, or, at least, alleviate, by every means in his
power, the miseries of their condition, is compelled, against
every feeling of his heart, not only to hold them
in servitude, but to keep them in absolute ignorance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although these laws are founded neither in humanity,
nor Christianity, yet evidently in <i>good policy</i>;
and they are necessarily connected with slavery, in the
extent to which it exists. The physical power of the
black population, in many districts of our country,
bears such an alarming proportion to that of the whites,
that nothing is wanting on their part but information, to
enable them to assert and maintain their rights. Only
let them know what they are, and of what they are capable,
and in one month’s time the Tragedy of St. Domingo
would be re-acted on this side of the Gulf-Stream.</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time, my hearers, I presume you have begun
to inquire for the remedy of this “legion of evils:”
and some of you may have drawn the conclusion, that nothing
short of the immediate and absolute emancipation
of all the slaves of our country would satisfy my mind.
But this is not the fact. However highly my feelings
may be wrought on this subject, they have not got the
better of my understanding. I am perfectly satisfied
that it is one of those evils which cannot be removed
by a single stroke. The immediate emancipation of
all the slaves, would doubtless be attended with consequences,
both upon themselves and the whites, vastly
more terrible and distressing, than all the horrours
of slavery. And if St. Paul himself were now on
earth, and consulted on the subject, I doubt not he
would disapprove of such a measure. It has been already
shown that there are evils existing in the pagan
world, which are directly opposed to Christianity; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>yet the genius of the gospel, upon its first introduction,
does not demand their immediate and entire abolition.
And although this country is not strictly speaking a
pagan country, yet the practice in question is a pagan
practice; and so effectually wrought into the habits
and feelings and institutions of our land, that its complete
extirpation must necessarily be the work of time.—But
here let it be particularly observed, that, in all
such cases, we have no licence for the toleration of any
sinful custom, a single moment, without the adoption of
wise and prudent measures calculated ultimately to
abolish it.</p>

<p class='c012'>This, it appears to me, is the only course that can
be adopted in this country for the annihilation of slavery;
and in this point of view, I introduce to your notice,
the object and operations of the “<i>American Colonization
Society</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This association was formed, at the city of Washington,
in the beginning of the year 1817; and is patronized
by many of the most distinguished officers of
the general government. The Chief Justice of the United
States has been, from its first formation, the president
of the Society. Its object is the transportation
to Africa of the free people of colour, who are willing
to go, and the establishment of them in a colony, or colonies,
under all the advantages of civil and religious
privileges. Though its incipient measures were attended
with some adverse providences, yet it has progressed
with as much success, and with as flattering prospects
as could possibly have been anticipated. A district of
fertile territory on the Western Coast of Africa has
been purchased of the natives, and a flourishing colony
planted there, under the direction and control of resident
agents. Schools are organized, and the means of
grace established among them. The plan has been
countenanced, though not explicitly approved, by the
government of our country; and it has been distinctly
recommended by the supreme judicatories of several
of the most numerous and respectable denominations
of Christians to the patronage of their members, especially
on this interesting occasion.</p>

<p class='c012'>As this Society, since its organization, has met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>with considerable opposition, I feel it to be my duty to
present a few considerations in support of its claims.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the slaves of our country are ever to enjoy all
the blessings of freedom, it must evidently be, in a state
of total separation from the white population. Such
are the present feelings of our citizens, and so firmly
are they fixed in their breasts, that we need never expect
to see the blacks amalgamated with the whites in
all the social connexions of life. In what district of
our country will the latter become willing to connect
themselves with the former in the relations of the domestick
circle? What legislature will be willing to admit
the negro to equal privileges and powers with the
white man, on the floor of the senate chamber? What
University will hold forth the same advantages and honours
to our own children and the descendants of Africans?
But until all these things are realized, if they
must live together in the same territory, the negro’s
mind will forever be depressed to the dust with a sense
of conscious inferiority, and can never aspire to those
elevated distinctions of which it is capable. And this
is the grand reason of all that present dulness and stupidity,
which are frequently adduced, as evidence that
negroes are a race of beings but little elevated above
the brutal creation. If therefore universal liberty
should be proclaimed through our land, and the African
race still be permitted to live in the midst of us,
disfranchised by our feelings and customs, if not by our
laws,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of the rights of freemen, we have no reason to
suppose that they would be essentially improved or
benefited by their freedom. It is therefore most palpably
manifest, that if our slaves are ever to enjoy all
the blessings of liberty, they must not only be liberated
from the chains of bondage, but at the same time,
be placed in a situation in which they may aspire to all
the advantages and distinctions of civilized life.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c016'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In some of the states, even where slavery is abolished, the blacks are disfranchised
of the rights of citizens. To the eternal disgrace of our own state, the despotick principles
of our Constitution have been multiplied instead of being diminished by the late Convention.
By the old Constitution, only one class of citizens were divested of certain natural rights
without having committed any crime to forfeit them. But by the present Constitution there
are two. And the reasons in both cases are very similar; in the one, <i>wearing a black coat</i>,
and in the other, <i>a black skin</i>. But the operation of these regulations is much more oppressive
in the latter, than in the former case. The colour of a man’s dress depends on his own
will; but, “<i>the Ethiopian</i> <span class='fss'>CANNOT</span> <i>change his skin</i>,” if he would.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>This is the immediate object of the Colonization
Society. Nor is it a mere matter of doubtful experiment.
A similar attempt has long since been made
by the British nation, at Sierra Leone, and the result has
fully proven to the world, that the minds of black men
are as capable as the whites, when placed under equal
circumstances of improvement. The same results are
beginning to be realized in the infant colony planted by
our own countrymen at Cape Mesurado. And nothing
is wanting, but the patronage of our own citizens, to extend
the same advantages to hundreds and thousands of
the degraded and oppressed sons of Africa, who are
still in our land.</p>

<p class='c012'>In further confirmation of the same views, it may
be observed, that in the slave-holding states there are
many owners of slaves who would gladly emancipate
them, but are expressly prohibited. It is impossible,
therefore, for them to proclaim “liberty to the captives,”
unless they can transport them without the limits of the
state. What then can such benevolent masters do with
their slaves? To turn them out into our western wilds,
would be to expose them to certain starvation; or if any
survived, they would be hunted down as wild beasts, by
a herd of brutal kidnappers, and carried back and sold
to less merciful masters than they served before. To
transport them to a foreign shore, if any individual were
able to incur the expense, without any concert of action,
would be to expose them to immediate death by
barbarous hands. It is therefore impossible to afford
those who are disposed, an opportunity to emancipate
their slaves, without such a concert of action as shall
protect the colony in its infantile state, till it shall acquire
strength and ability to defend itself. Such is the
object of the Colonization Society.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let not this effort of beneficence be paralized by
the plea, that it is an insignificant undertaking compared
with the magnitude of the evil intended to be removed.
Did you never see a cloud, no bigger than a
man’s hand, at its first appearance, finally overspread
the whole horizon and pour a copious blessing on the
thirsty earth? What plan of benevolence, in this fallen
world, was not small at its commencement? Even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>kingdom of God was once like <i>a grain of mustard seed</i>;
but it has gradually increased and will continue to grow
till it fills the world. The Herculean labour of abolishing
the slave-trade, with all its bloody horrours, was
commenced, within our recollection, by a single individual,
in the legislature of a single nation, amidst the
clamours of a host of opposition; and yet that individual
has lived, and we have lived, to see the horrid traffick
proscribed, not only by that nation, but by the civilized
world, and the practice declared <i>piracy</i> by several
nations. What influence then can a consideration
of the smallness of the means, compared with the end,
have upon the benevolent mind in relation to this subject?
It may indeed stimulate to increased exertion,
but it surely can produce no discouraging effect.</p>

<p class='c012'>But even admitting that the efforts of this Society
should never ultimately accomplish the object of its
aim, <i>the entire abolition of American slavery</i>, there is one
important result which it cannot fail to produce. Besides
securing the blessings of freedom and self-government
to some of those who had previously groaned under
the chains of bitter servitude, it will afford a ready
introduction of the blessings of civilization and the gospel
to the benighted tribes of Africa. It is recorded
in God’s sure word of prophecy, that “Ethiopia shall
stretch forth her hands to God,” while “the isles of the
sea shall wait for his law.” In view of the numerous
and simultaneous efforts of the Christian world to extend
the blessings of the gospel to the ends of the earth,
we may justly consider the exertions of the American
Colonization Society as ultimately, though not directly,
aiming at the same object; and we may with propriety
regard the Institution as one important wheel in that
vast system of moral machinery which, under the blessing
of heaven, is destined to regenerate a fallen world.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this view of the subject, I cannot but indulge in
what some may call the flights of fancy, but what I fondly
persuade myself is the reality of vision. O Africa,
long oppressed and degraded Africa! Heaven has witnessed
thy bitter sufferings, and the long black catalogue
of thy wrongs is hid up in store against the day of retribution.
But I see the Sun of righteousness arising upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>thee, with healing in his wings. I see the shades of
more than Egyptian darkness dispelled by his resplendent
rays. I see thy wounds, which have been bleeding
for ages, instantly staunched and healed. I see the ferocity
of the tyger exchanged for the meekness of the
lamb. I hear thy groves and plains resounding with
the shouts of joy and gladness, and the still sweeter
song of redeeming grace and love. I see “thy wildernesses
and solitary places made glad, and thy desert rejoicing
and blossoming as the rose. Thy parched ground
has become a pool, and thy thirsty land springs of water.
In the habitation of dragons, where each lay, there is
grass with reeds and rushes. And a high way is there,
and a way that is called the Way of Holiness: the unclean
shall not pass over it: but it shall be for thee;
the way-faring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go
up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed
shall walk there. And the ransomed of the Lord
shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting
joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and
gladness; <i>and sorrow and sighing</i> shall flee away.” Isaiah
xxxv. 1-10. These blessed results I see effected
by the instrumentality of America, the author of all
thy wrongs. And though thy sweat and tears and blood
have, for ages, been crying to heaven from the ground,
for vengeance on her devoted head; yet now I hear thy
voice, in the true spirit of gospel forgiveness, intreating
pardon for thy guilty murderers. “O remember not against
them their <i>former</i> iniquities.” I see a tide of pious
joy and gratitude, flowing from thy streaming eyes,
sufficient, if aught but a Saviour’s blood were sufficient,
to wash away their crimson stains. O happy, happy
land, once wretched and forlorn! Thy mother’s children
shall no longer be angry with thee, because thou
art black, because the sun hath looked upon thee—they
shall no longer make thee keeper of their vineyards,
while thine own vineyard lies waste. Thy complexion
is indeed black, but comely; and thy soul has been
washed in the fountain of redeeming grace, as white
and as pure as the redeemed of any other clime; and
thou canst now chaunt as high a note of praise to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>God of thy salvation; and though here thou hast been
excluded from the rights of freemen, and the society of
white men, yet in heaven thou shalt mingle, without
discrimination, among the blood-bought throng, and
there occupy as high a throne, and wear as bright a
crown.</p>

<p class='c012'>In urging the claims of this subject, it is necessary
that I should obviate an objection which is frequently
made in this section of the country. It is said that
“this is a matter in which we have no concern at all—that
it belongs exclusively to the southern states.” If
this plea were founded in fact, are we willing to admit,
that the citizens of the northern states are so selfish,
that they have no sympathy for the sufferings of humanity,
if they are only out of sight? But I am bold
to assert that this objection is utterly groundless; and
that there is not a single native or naturalized citizen
in the United States but is verily guilty in this
matter. It is a well known fact, that in every original
state in the union, excepting one, slavery has been sanctioned;
and that it still exists, to a greater or less extent,
in all the states and territories with the exception
of five. Now it is useless for a man to plead <i>not guilty</i>
to the charge of murder, because he has taken the life
of only one individual, while others may have slain their
thousands. It is the <i>principle</i> we are concerned with,
and the principle of slavery has been as firmly sanctioned
in most of the northern states, as in any part of the
union; though our citizens have never found it for their
interest to carry it as far. But for this single circumstance,
I presume every farm in this region would now
be cultivated by the labour, and watered by the sweat
of negroes. With what an ill grace then can any, who
have implicitly or explicitly sworn allegiance to the institutions
of their respective states and the general government,
especially those who have been, or still are
the owners of human flesh and blood, hold up their
heads and say, “We are pure from the blood of Africans?”</p>

<p class='c012'>But, my hearers, I have not yet presented this subject
in the light of its most appalling darkness; nor applied
the sharpest point of its universal bearing. <i>The</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><i>union of these States was originally purchased at the price
of the blood and groans of Africa</i>; and <i>all our citizens</i>
from the north and the south, from the east and the
west, <i>gave their consent to the bargain</i>. One section of
the constitution of the United States was written, like
the laws of Draco, in lines of blood; the blood of Africans.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
By it, all the horrours of the slave-trade, the
whole root and stock and branch of which slavery is
the bitter fruit, were firmly sanctioned for thirty tedious
years. During this gloomy period, under the
sanction of the charter of freemen, and of freemen too,
who, in the days of their emancipation from the chains
of despotism, appealed to heaven for the sincerity of
their intentions, while they declared to the world “that
all men are created equal, and endowed by their Creator
with an unalienable right to life, <i>liberty</i> and the pursuit
of happiness;” under the sanction of such a charter,
adopted by such men, and under such circumstances,
thousands and tens of thousands of harmless Africans,
who were born free as the air of heaven, or the
streams of the fountain, were forcibly dragged from
their native shores, bound with massy chains, crowded
into the filthy hold of a floating dungeon, without power
to rise or room to stand; and when multitudes had
been swept off by wasting pestilence, and found a watery
grave, the wretched remnant, emaciated with famine
and worn down with disease, were sold under the
hammer into perpetual bondage. Without the sanction
of all these horrours, the union of these states would
never have been effected. And in consenting to this
measure, the northern states became voluntarily partakers
with those of the south, in all the guilt of the barbarous
slave-trade and all its horrid consequences.</p>

<p class='c012'>O my country! what atonement canst thou make
for such bloody crimes? What fountain, but that which
flows from Calvary, can wash away thy crimson stains?
In vain wouldst thou offer “many thousands of rams, or
ten thousands of rivers of oil. The blood of thy firstborn
would not expiate thy transgression, nor the fruit
of thy body, the sin of thy soul.” Mic. vi. 7. “Though
thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord
God.” Jer. ii. 22. I beseech thee, do not aggravate
thy guilt, and provoke anew the wrath of heaven, by
justifying thy deeds or pleading innocent of the charge.
“For thy sin is written with a pen of iron, and with the
point of a diamond; it is graven on the table of thy
heart, and” if not “upon the horns of thy altars,” it is
inscribed in the archives of thy cabinet, and whilst thy
children shall read the legacies of their fathers they
shall remember and bear witness of thy crimes, to the
latest posterity. Fly, O fly, in the first place, to the
fountain of a Saviour’s bleeding veins, and there be
washed from all thy pollution: and then, as a testimony
of thy gratitude, that much, very much is forgiven
thee, summon all thy energies to repair the injuries
thou hast done. “Proclaim liberty to thy captives;
say to the prisoners, go forth; and to them that are in
darkness, show yourselves.” Isa. xlix. 9. Restore them
to “the land of their fathers’ sepulchres,” and let them
once more peacefully enjoy the inheritance of their
ancestors. Wherever they may have been born, Africa
is their home. Though transported to the most distant
countries, and situated in the most temperate regions
of the globe, and transmitted through a series of
generations, they still retain in the constitution of their
frames, and on the whole surface of their bodies, the title
of heaven to those torrid climes. The God of nature
has evidently determined, that they shall never be
divested of their original inheritance. Though “the
descendants of Cush can never change their skin,” yet
the time will come when their souls shall be made white
in the blood of the Lamb; and then, in their own land,
which God allotted to their progenitor, they shall stretch
forth their hands to God, and under their own vine and
fig-tree enjoy the fruit of their labours, without any to
molest or make them afraid.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is one consideration more, by which I would
urge the claims of this subject. If the people of the
United States cannot be extensively aroused to undertake
the redress of African wrongs, from motives of
humanity, and a sense of duty, the apprehension of personal
danger may with propriety be awakened in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>minds. God deals with nations, in this world, on a different
principle from what he deals with individuals.—The
wicked man is often permitted to prosper in his
sins, and to die without pain; because the righteous retributions
of justice await him in the eternal world.—But
wicked nations exist, in their national capacity,
only in this life. Therefore, if national sins are ever
visited with the indignation of heaven, it must be in the
present world. Hence, we may draw the conclusion,
that if American slavery is offensive to God, the judgments
of heaven are now impending over this guilty nation.
And in what form they will descend, we need not
the spirit of prophecy to prognosticate. In several of
the slave-holding states, the black population is already
nearly equal to the white; and the ratio of increase is so
much in their favour, that, in the course of a few years,
they will be far the most numerous. During the period
of ten years intervening between the last United
States’ census and the preceding, the following was the
ratio of increase in several states:</p>
<div class='std-table'>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In Kentucky, the blacks increased 57 per cent, whites only 37 per cent.</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Tennessee, the blacks increased 80 per cent, whites only 57 per cent.</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Georgia, the blacks increased 40 per cent, whites only 30 per cent.</div>
      <div class='line in3'>North-Carolina, the blacks increased 22 per cent, whites only 11 per cent.</div>
      <div class='line in3'>South-Carolina, the blacks increased 26 per cent, whites only 8 per cent.</div>
      <div class='line'>And in Louisiana as early as 1810 there were 5 blacks to every four white men.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>It is obvious, that, at this rate, in the course of a few years, those
districts of our country will be covered with a black population; in
comparison with which, the whites will appear as grasshoppers before
them. Now I ask, in such a state of things, what can hinder the blacks
from arising, and after avenging all their wrongs, by slaying their opposers,
taking possession of those very lands as the reward of their own
and their fathers’ labours? Do you say, their minds are incapable of
such an enterprize? Look at St. Domingo; what has been effected
there by the African race, in as ignorant and degraded a state as is any
where witnessed in our own country! And what will our blacks need,
but a few resolute spirits to concentrate their efforts and direct their
energies? And if the genius of negroes is so far debased in our own
country, that nature cannot produce them here, they can easily be furnished
from the kingdom of Hayti. Though that little empire is now
at peace with us and the world, yet black men have always a peculiar
sympathy for their own colour. Besides this, many of our own free
blacks have already gone, and many more will still go to that island, to
enjoy all the blessings of liberty, civilization and science; leaving many
of their brothers and children and connexions in bondage among us.—And
do you think that a black man’s memory is so treacherous, or his
heart so callous, that he can forget, or not feel for the wrongs of his
own flesh and blood? Depend upon it, my hearers, on the shore of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>sea-beaten isle, many a champion will stand, and while he looks to the
north and rejoices in the privileges which he is permitted to enjoy, he
will long to impart them to those he has left behind; and if nothing is
done, on your part, to redress the wrongs of Africa, before you are aware,
the alarm of war, the din of arms, and the rage of conflagration
will have laid in ruins the fairest portions of our land.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c016'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If any are disposed to style this mere conjecture, be it so: but it is no more than
what has already occurred, and may occur again. The revolution in St. Domingo originated
in France, and was planned by a Society called <i>Amis de Noirs</i>, or Friends of the Blacks,
organized in Paris for the express purpose of aiding the negroes in recovering their liberty;
of which La Fayette and other distinguished citizens were the patrons. And the first individual
that drew his sword, was a mulatto who had been educated in Paris, and sent to his
native isle to deliver his coloured brethren from bondage.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Do I hear the inhabitants of the north say, “If such events should
be realized, the desolation will not come nigh us; and we will not interfere
to avenge the slaughter of slave-holders!” And are you then
prepared to perjure yourselves? You have sworn to maintain the union
of these states, at the price of your treasures and your lives; and are
you now meditating treason and rebellion in your hearts? You have
become a party to the guilt of slavery, and will you desert your friends
when the contract on the part of heaven is to be fulfilled?</p>

<p class='c012'>But if you are verily guilty in this matter, do not imagine that you
can evade the punishment of such a crime. It is the righteous God of
heaven that pleads the cause of the oppressed: and, though the scene
of battle may not be laid at your doors; though the fiercest wrath may
be poured out upon those portions of our country where slavery has
existed in its most extensive and cruel forms; yet the hand of justice
will, in some way or other, mete out to every district the full tale of its
desert. Let us hear no more then of local jealousies and feelings, but
as the sin has involved us in a <i>common guilt</i>, let us aim at a common
and timely expiation. The path of present duty lies open before us, and
it is only by diligent and faithful perseverance therein, that we can expect
to escape the indignation of heaven.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is a concern in which every citizen of the country is interested;
whether he is now or ever has been a slave-holder or not: and
there is something for every one to do. The sympathies of every heart
must be aroused; the patronage of every purse must be secured in favour
of these incipient measures to remedy the evil; publick attention
must not only be aroused by an occasional effusion, but be kept awake
by frequent communications; the general government must be convinced
that it is not enough to countenance, they must approve and aid this
humane undertaking—that the fountain of guilt springs from the foundation
of our Capitol, and that the principal remedy must be applied there;
our state legislatures must be made to feel that they also have imbrued
their hands in African blood, and that not a moment is to be lost in washing
away the stain. Every motive that can interest the philanthropist,
the patriot, the Christian and the Christian Missionary is presented in
this subject, and he that can be insensible of its influence is unworthy
to occupy a place in human society, unless in the capacity of “a servant
of servants.”</p>

<p class='c012'>May the voice of timely warning arouse us, before the sword of
sleepless justice smite our souls.</p>

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
